# My AI Productivity Blog

This repository contains the source code for my personal blog where I discuss AI tools, productivity tips, and tech insights.

The blog is built using React and aims to provide helpful content for anyone looking to leverage technology for personal and professional growth.

## Features (Planned)

*   Blog post listing and individual post views
*   Categories and tags for posts
*   Search functionality
*   Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React, CSS (potentially with Tailwind CSS)
*   **Backend:** (To be decided - could be static site generation, Firebase, or a simple Node.js backend)

## Getting Started

Details on how to run the project locally will be added here soon.

## Contributing

This is currently a personal project, but suggestions or contributions might be considered in the future.
